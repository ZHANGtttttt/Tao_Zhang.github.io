title: "Enhancing Delicate Flexible Endoscopic Maneuvers: A Fully Soft and Tissue-Compliant Force Sensor based on Fiber Bragg Grating"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-ICRA-Workshop-opti
excerpt: ' in this work, we proposed a fully flexible force sensor composed of FBG and silicone for improved maneuverability in narrow environments. The sensing part is fixed at the end of a flexible parallel continuum wrist (FPCW), providing the sensor with higher flexibility. '
