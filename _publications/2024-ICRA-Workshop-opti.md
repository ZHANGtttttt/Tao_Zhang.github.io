**Introduction:**
In recent years, with the development of endoscopic surgical robots, the demand for sensing information during endoscopic procedures has gradually emerged. Considering the unique structure of flexible endoscopes, sensors need to pass through narrow and winding working channels to enter the target tissue. Therefore, the design of sensors for flexible endoscopy needs to comprehensively consider factors such as passage through winding channels, stable long-distance signal transmission, sensing accuracy, and mini size. Currently, there are various types of sensors applied to surgical instruments, such as resistive sensors and optical sensors. Among them, optical sensors based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) operate by sensing the wavelength information reflected by the optical fiber. Optical fibers have small diameters, and flexible characteristics, and the sensing process does not require additional auxiliary facilities. Therefore, FBG sensors are one of the ideal methods for flexible instrument sensing. Currently, shape sensing of flexible instruments based on FBG has been widely applied.  Various FBG force sensors for minimally invasive surgery have also been proposed. However, many of them still adopt rigid substrates, which can, to some extent, affect their performance in flexible endoscope systems. Recently, FBG sensors based on flexible substrates have also been studied. However, their structures are still relatively simple, and the dimensions of the force sensor are relatively limited. Therefore, in this work, we proposed a fully flexible force sensor composed of FBG and silicone for improved maneuverability in narrow environments. The sensing part is fixed at the end of a flexible parallel continuum wrist (FPCW), providing the sensor with higher flexibility.
