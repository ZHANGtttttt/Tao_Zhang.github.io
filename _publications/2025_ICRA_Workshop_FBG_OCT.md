excerpt: ' Due to severe size limitations, conventional tactile and visual diagnostic methods, such as tactile sensing and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning, are challenging to achieve in robot-assisted transendoscopic minimally invasive surgery. However, this information is the crucial basis for a surgeon in identifying early-stage tumors that are difficult to distinguish using the endoscopic camera. To solve this issue, we propose a steerable transendoscopic bimodal palpation sensor (TBS) with tactile-visual perception ability. The sensing unit of this sensor consists of fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), OCT fibers, and the flexible skeleton. By integrating two modes of sensing fibers, the proposed TBS can realize the tactile information perception of the contact area and the layered information perception of the biological structure, which is of great significance for realizing the transendoscopic non-destructive inspection. The phantom experiment results show that the proposed tool can detect tumor boundaries and hierarchical structures, and the FBG-based boundary detection accuracy is over 99%.'
